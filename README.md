# ProDev Backend Engineering program.
- This program is designed to take the foundational knowledge in programming and elevate it to new heights. It dives deep into advanced topics and help's the student apply these techniques in real-world applications.

## Major learnings Include:
- Key technologies covered:
    - Python, Django, REST APIs, GraphQL, Docker, CI/CD

## Important backend development concepts covered
- Database Design, Asynchronous Programming, Caching Strategies

## Challenges faced and solutions implemented
    1. Late submission of weekly assignments => Creating a time everyday to complete the tasks in time
    2. Issues with checker => Checking discord comments to find solutions for the problem concerning the checker in question
    3. Limmited time to understand a broad concept => creating more time to learn the tool and also learning during implementation

## Best practices and personal takeaways
    1. The program is more of a starter to keep you going and growing in the field of Software Engineering
    2. It needs alot of dilligence to completely master the concepts layout in the program
    3. It needs daily practice and study

# E COMMERCE WEBSITE
- This case study focuses on developing a robust backend system to support an e-commerce product catalog. The backend will handle product data management, user authentication, and APIs for filtering, sorting, and pagination, simulating a real-world scenario for backend engineers.
- This program is created in as a requirement of succesfully completing the ProDev Software Engineering Program of ALX, and at the same time we have in mind that it would be a project to add to our portfolio when searching for jobs.
- It is website that enables transaction between a buyer (browses available producsts, places there orders and makes payments) and a seller (adds products to the website and deliveres products successfully bought) through the internet.

## BackEnd Features
The tools used include
|No|Tools|Purpose|
|:--|:-----|:-------|
|1|Python Django REST|For building a scalable backend framework|
|2|PostgreSQL|As the relational database for optimized performance|
|3|JWT|For secure user authentication.|
|4|Swagger|To document|
|5|Postman|Test the API Endpoints|
|6|Celery|Implement Assycronouse services|
|7|Redis|Implement caching|

## Implementation Process
```
# Git Commit Workflow
feat: set up Django project with PostgreSQL
feat: implement user authentication with JWT
feat: add product APIs with filtering and pagination
feat: integrate Swagger documentation for API endpoints
perf: optimize database queries with indexing
docs: add API usage instructions in Swagger
```
